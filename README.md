 Use Case
--------------
QuestionService provides questions like:
At Postman when hitting with the below address (GET Request)
http://localhost:8081/quiz/1
The Result would appear in JSON format

{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "java quiz",
    "questions": [
        {
            "questionId": 1,
            "question": "what is java",
            "quizId": 1
        },
        {
            "questionId": 2,
            "question": "what is spring boot",
            "quizId": 1
        },
        {
            "questionId": 3,
            "question": "what is Thread",
            "quizId": 1
        }
    ]
}

Another Example with Quiz 2

http://localhost:8081/quiz/2

Output:
{
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Phython quiz",
    "questions": [
        {
            "questionId": 4,
            "question": "what is phython",
            "quizId": 2
        },
        {
            "questionId": 5,
            "question": "what is data science",
            "quizId": 2
        }
    ]
}
